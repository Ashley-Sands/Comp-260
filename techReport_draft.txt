-------
From single instance games server to a dynamicly scalable solution,
Getting prepaprted for could orchestration 

#TODO:
- [ ] Add testing protocols to single server
- [ ] Add Testing protocols to scalable server

- [ ] make docker and deploy single

- [ ] Get bench marks for both

# NOTES.
## The test (both)

- [ ] ping
- [ ] message
- [ ] all lobby data (fast request)
- [ ] lobby update
- [ ] random game commands

### PING PROTOTYPE

The ping protocols is sent from the client to the server and returned.
the process time is the amount of time from queing the outbout message to reciveing it back
the server has to process the message in the same way as any other message. 
the ping is not just recived and imeadetly returned.

Can garentee that the cient and host time match. but the time that the server recives the message is recorded.
